title: Diatom detection with oriented bounding boxes
summary: "Diatoms detection with oriented bounding boxes."
description: |-
  diamorph_detection is an application using the DEEPaaS API.

  It is designed to predict oriented bounding boxes around diatoms. 
  It is based on a pre-trained yolov8 that has been finetuned on manually
  labeled data.

  This application only provides the inference endpoint.

  **History and contributors**

  The project was initiated by the PhD of Aishwarya Venkataramanan using YoloV5 working on both detection and classification [1], cosupervized by Cédric Pradalier and Martin Laviale. At that time
  it was using axis aligned bounding boxes. Later, thanks to the support of PNRIA (Programme National de Recherche en Intelligence Artificielle) and the work
  of Cyril Regan, the code base was improved, the project was ported to Yolov5 with oriented bounding boxes and a web frontend added [2]. The project was finally ported
  to the iMagine platform with Yolov8 by Jeremy Fix.

  The database used to train the Yolov8 is Cleurie/Orne, 2867 images, and 9822 instances annotated by Corentin Galinier and Martin Laviale. The running model is a pretrained Yolov8m-obb finetuned on the Cleurie/Orne dataset.
