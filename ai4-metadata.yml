title: Diatom detection
summary: "Diatoms detection with oriented bounding boxes."
description: |-
  diamorph_detection is an application using the DEEPaaS API.

  It is designed to predict oriented bounding boxes around diatoms. 
  It is based on a pre-trained yolov8 that has been finetuned on manually
  labeled data.

  This application only provides the inference endpoint.
